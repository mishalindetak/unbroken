# Unbroken
This is a Tumblr theme. It makes use of Bootstrap 3, Bootswatch themes, Font Awesome, and ekko-lightbox.

## For users
Empty the Edit Theme > Edit HTML screen, then copy the contents of unbroken.html into it and save. That's it.

## For developers
To generate the html file to upload to tumblr, you will need make, m4, and sed. In other words, you need a typical Linux or other UNIX-like system. Just open the directory containing the theme files in a terminal, and type ```make```

If you want to fix something and have your change be accepted, modify the m4 file not the html. The html file is provided only for convenience.
