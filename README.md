# Unbroken
This is a Tumblr theme. It makes use of Bootstrap 3, Bootswatch themes, and ekko-lightbox.

To generate the html file to upload to tumblr, you will need make, m4, and sed. In other words, you need a typical Linux or other UNIX-like system. If you want to fix something and have your change be accepted, modify the m4 file not the html. The html file is provided only for convenience.
